You can now call Athena with AWS Step Functions\. AWS Step Functions can control certain AWS services directly using the [Amazon States Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html)\. You can use Step Functions with Athena to start and stop query execution, get query results, run ad\-hoc or scheduled data queries, and retrieve results from data lakes in Amazon S3\.

For more information, see [Call Athena with Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-athena.html) in the *AWS Step Functions Developer Guide*\.
