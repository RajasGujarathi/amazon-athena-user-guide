# Amazon Athena Timestream Connector<a name="athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-timestream"></a>

Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed, purpose\-built time series database that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of time series data points per day\. Timestream saves you time and cost in managing the lifecycle of time series data by keeping recent data in memory and moving historical data to a cost optimized storage tier based upon user defined policies\. For more information, see the [Amazon Timestream Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/what-is-timestream.html)\.

The Amazon Athena Timestream connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with Amazon Timestream timeseries data\. You can optionally use AWS Glue Data Catalog as a source of supplemental metadata\. 

For information about configuration options, setting up databases and tables, data types, permissions, deployment, performance, and licensing, see [Amazon Athena Timestream Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-timestream) on GitHub\.
