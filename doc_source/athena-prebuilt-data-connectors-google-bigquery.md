The Amazon Athena connector for Google [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) enables Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on data in Google BigQuery\. For information about configuration options, data type support, and other considerations, see [Amazon Athena Google BigQuery connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-google-bigquery/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/Available-Connectors)\.

Before you use this connector, you must set up a VPC and a security group\. For more information, see [Creating a VPC for a data source connector](athena-connectors-vpc-creation.md)\.
