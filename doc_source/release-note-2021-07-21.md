With the July 2021 release of [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/), you can create reports and dashboards using a native data source connector for Amazon Athena\. The connector for Amazon Athena is available as a standard connector in Power BI, supports [DirectQuery](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery), and enables analysis on large datasets and content refresh through [Power BI Gateway](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/gateway/)\.

Because the connector uses your existing ODBC data source name \(DSN\) to connect to and run queries on Athena, it requires the Athena ODBC driver\. To download the latest ODBC driver, see [Connecting to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md)\.
