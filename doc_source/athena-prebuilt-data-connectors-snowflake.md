# Amazon Athena Snowflake connector<a name="athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-snowflake"></a>

The Amazon Athena connector for [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) enables Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on data stored in Snowflake\. For information about configuration options, data type support, and other considerations, see [Amazon Athena Snowflake connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-snowflake/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/Available-Connectors)\.

Before you use this connector, you must set up a VPC and a security group\. For more information, see [Creating a VPC for a data source connector](athena-connectors-vpc-creation.md)\.
