# Amazon Athena OpenSearch connector<a name="athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-elasticsearch"></a>

The Amazon Athena OpenSearch connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with your OpenSearch instances so that you can use SQL to query your OpenSearch data\. This connector works with the Amazon OpenSearch Service or any OpenSearch\-compatible endpoint that is configured with OpenSearch version 7\.0 or higher\.

For information about configuration options, databases and tables, data types, deployment, and performance considerations, see [Amazon Athena OpenSearch connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-elasticsearch) on GitHub\.
