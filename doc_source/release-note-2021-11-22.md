You can now manage AWS Step Functions workflows from the Amazon Athena console, making it easier to build scalable data processing pipelines, execute queries based on custom business logic, automate administrative and alerting tasks, and more\.

Step Functions is now integrated with Athena's upgraded console, and you can use it to view an interactive workflow diagram of your state machines that invoke Athena\. To get started, select **Workflows** from the left navigation panel\. If you have existing state machines with Athena queries, select a state machine to view an interactive diagram of the workflow\. If you are new to Step Functions, you can get started by launching a sample project from the Athena console and customizing it to suit your use cases\.
