On July 1, 2021, special handling of preview workgroups ended\. While `AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality` workgroups retain their name, they no longer have special status\. You can continue to use `AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality` workgroups to view, modify, organize, and run queries\. However, queries that use features that were formerly in preview are now subject to standard Athena billing terms and conditions\. For billing information, see [Amazon Athena pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/)\.
