# DML Queries, Functions, and Operators<a name="functions-operators-reference-section"></a>

Athena DML query statements are based on [Presto 0\.172](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/index.html) for Athena engine version 1 and [Presto 0\.217](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.217/index.html) for Athena engine version 2\. For information about Athena engine versions, see [Athena Engine Versioning](engine-versions.md)\.

For links to subsections of the Presto function documentation, see [Presto Functions](presto-functions.md)\. 

Athena does not support all of Presto's features, and there are some significant differences\. For more information, see the topics for specific statements in this section and [Considerations and Limitations](other-notable-limitations.md)\.
