# Configuration and vulnerability analysis in Athena<a name="security-vulnerability-management"></a>

Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage\. AWS handles basic security tasks, such as guest operating system \(OS\) and database patching, firewall configuration, and disaster recovery\. These procedures have been reviewed and certified by the appropriate third parties\. For more details, see the following AWSresources:
