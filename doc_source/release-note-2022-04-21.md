You can now use Amazon Athena to run federated queries on new data sources, including Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse, and Snowflake\. New data source connectors include:
+ [Azure Data Lake Storage \(ADLS\) Gen2](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-adls-gen2.md)
+ [Azure Synapse](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-azure-synapse.md)
+ [Cloudera Hive](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-cloudera-hive.md)
+ [Cloudera Impala](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-cloudera-impala.md)
+ [Google BigQuery](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-google-bigquery.md)
+ [Hortonworks](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-hortonworks.md)
+ [Microsoft SQL Server](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-microsoft-sql-server.md)
+ [Oracle](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-oracle.md)
+ [SAP HANA \(Express Edition\)](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-sap-hana.md)
+ [Snowflake](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-snowflake.md)
+ [Teradata](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-teradata.md)

For a complete list of data sources supported by Athena, see [Athena Data Source Connectors](athena-prebuilt-data-connectors.md)\.

To make it easier to browse the available sources and connect to your data, you can now search, sort, and filter the available connectors from an updated **Data Sources** screen in the Athena console\.
