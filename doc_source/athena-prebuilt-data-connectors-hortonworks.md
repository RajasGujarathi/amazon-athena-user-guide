# Amazon Athena Hortonworks Connector<a name="athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-hortonworks"></a>

The Amazon Athena connector for Hortonworks enables Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on the Cloudera [Hortonworks](https://www.cloudera.com/products/hdp.html) data platform\. The connector transforms your Athena SQL queries to their equivalent HiveQL syntax\. For information about configuration options, data type support, and other considerations, see [Amazon Athena Hortonworks Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-hortonworks-hive/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/Available-Connectors)\.

Before you use this connector, you must set up a VPC and a security group\. For more information, see [Creating a VPC for a data source connector](athena-connectors-vpc-creation.md)\.
